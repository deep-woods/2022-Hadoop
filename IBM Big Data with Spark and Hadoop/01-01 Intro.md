Apache Hadoop


## <span id='Overview'>Overview</span>

[[Top]](#top)

<br>

- Apache Hadoop
- Apache Spark 
- Apache Spark SQL
- Kubernetes 

<br>

### Big data

- Videos, photos, texts 
- Arrives continuously at enormous speed from multiple sources

<br>
 
### Big data life cycle 

- Business case
- Data Collection 
  - Hadoop HDFS: a framework for distributed storage
- Data Modelling
  - Hadoop Yarn, Hadoop MapReduce 
- Data Processing
  - Apache Spark, Hive, Apache Pig
- Data Visualisation

<br>

### Bits, bytes and more

| Bits = 0 or 1<br>8 Bits    | <br>= 1 Byte   |    |    |    |    |    |   |   |
| -- | -- | -- | -- | -- | -- | -- | -- | -- |
|    | 1024 Bytes   |  = 1 KB  |    |    |    |    |   |   |
|    |    |  1024 KB  | = 1 GB    |    |    |    |   |   |
|    |    |    |  1024 GB  |  = 1 TB  |    |    |   |   |
|    |    |    |    |  1024 TB  | = 1 PB   |    |   |   |
|    |    |    |    |    | 1024 PB   | = 1 EB  |   |   |
|    |    |    |    |    |    | 1024 EB   | = 1 ZB  |   |
|    |    |    |    |    |    |    | 1024 ZB  | = 1 YB |

- 1 EB = store 11 million movies in 4k resolution
- Modern computers generally ship with 1 ~ 5 TB hard drives

<br>

### 4Vs

- Velocity
  - data is generated fast
  - Process never stops
  - Batch, close to real time, Streaming
  - Drivers: improved connectivity and hardware / Rapid response time / Pre-calculated analysis
- Volume
  - Scale of data
  - PB, EB, ZB
  - Drivers: Increase in data resources / higher-resolution sensors / Scalable infrastructure
- Variety
  - data are generated by machines, people, processes
  - Mostly unstructuredd
  - Drivers: mobile technology / scalable infrastructure/ resilience / fault recovery / efficient storage and retrieval 
- Veracity: how do we know it's accurate?
  - Quality, origin, conformity of facts / accuracy of data / data that comes from people and processes
  - Addtributes: conssitency and completeness / integrity / ambiguity 
  - Drivers: cost and traceability / robust ingestion / low ETL mechanism

### Real-world big data applications 

- Amazon, Netflix and Spotify
  - Recommendation engines: offer specific recommendations based on customer preferences historical behavior\
  - Siri on Apple devices, Alexa on Amazon devices: devise answers to the infinite number of questions end-users 

- Google's proactive recommendations
  - traffic, weather
  - big data is used to forecast future needs and behavior.

## <span id='Parallelism'>Parallel Processing, Scaling, and Data Parallelism</span>

[[Top]](#top)

- Linear vs. Parallel processing
  - Linear == sequential
  - Parallel == simultaneous
- Parallel processing for big data
- Scalability and horizontal scaling
- Fault tolerance in parallel computing 

<br>

### Parallel processing

- The problem statement is broken down into a set of executable instructions. 
- The instructions are then distributed to multiple execution nodes of equal processing power and are executed in parallel. 
- Since the instructions are run on separate execution nodes, errors can be fixed and executed locally independent of other instructions.
  - Reduced processing time
  - Less memory
  - Execution node balancing

<br> 

### Fault tolerance

- The ability of a system to continue operating without interruption when one or more of its components fail.
  - HDFS (Hadoop primary data storage system)
  - AWS S3 and object storage

- Hadoop filesystem is a robust and time-tested framework, reliable to 5 9s (99.999%).

### The Ecosystem

- Data technologies
- Analytics & visualisation
- Business intelligence
- Cloud Providers
- NoSQL Databases
- Programming tools 

<br> 

- Data technologies
  - Capture, process, and share data at any scale and in any format
  - Leverage high-performance, parallel big data processing
  - `Hadoop`, `HDFS`, `Spark`, `MapReduce`, `Cloudera`, `Databricks`
    - `MapReduce`: a framework that allows code to be written to run at scale on a Hadoop cluster. It is still in used, but `Apache Spark` is taking over.

- Analytics & visualisation
  - `Tableau`, `Palantir`, `SAS`, `Pentaho`, `Teradata`

- Business intelligence
  - `Cognos`, `Oracle`, `PowerBI`, `Business Object`, `Hyperion`

- Cloud Providers
  - `AWS`, `IBM`, `GCP`, `Oracle`

- NoSQL Databases
  - used for big data processing
  - store information in `json` instead of relational tables
  - `MongoDB`, `CouchDB`, `Cassandra`, `Redis`

- Programming tools 
  - `R`, `Python`, `SQL`, `Scala`, `Julia`

<br>

### Hadoop Ecosystem

- `Apache Hbase`: NoSQL datastore; Manages storage and computation resources outside of the Hadoop ecosystem but often resides on the same cluster.
- `HDP`: Hortonworks Data Platform provides a set of big data tools that are already configured to work together, and include most of the important open source packages (`Hadoop`, `Spark`, `Hive`, `Hbase`, ...).
